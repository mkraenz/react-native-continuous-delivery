# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Build and Deploy

### Android

Follow all the steps described in the [RN docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android).

#### Testing builds locally

```sh
cd android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release

# adjust the path to bundletool.jar
java -jar /home/mirco/Downloads/can-be-deleted/bundletool.jar build-apks --bundle=app-release.aab --output=my_app.apks --mode=universal --ks ../../../../my-upload-key.keystore --ks-key-alias my-key-alias
unzip my_app.apks
adb install universal.apk
```
